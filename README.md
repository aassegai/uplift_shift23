# uplift_shift23
Here is my solution for SHIFT Uplift 23 kaggle competition (kaggle.com/competitions/uplift-shift-23). 
I placed 22nd on the leaderboard, but scoring meant nothing there because all the solutions were close to random guessing (0.5 ROC AUC). 
Since the datasets are attached to the Kaggle competition, the code here is not runnable. You can run it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/aassegai/andrey-nepomnyashchy/notebook).
